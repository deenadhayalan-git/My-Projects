# MEMS-Based Machine Vibration Monitoring and Management System

**Role:** Team Member — Hardware & Implementation  
**Tools:** ESP32, ADXL345, GSM (SIM800), Blynk, Arduino IDE, 16x2 LCD  
**Description:** Portable IoT system that measures 3-axis vibration, shows readings on LCD and Blynk, and sends SMS alerts when thresholds are exceeded. Designed for low-cost predictive maintenance.

## Features
- Real-time 3-axis vibration monitoring (ADXL345)
- Local display (16x2 LCD) + remote visualization (Blynk)
- SMS alert via GSM when vibration > threshold
- Portable power supply (Li-ion battery + charge module)
